#Project:
Project Expenses are set by you. Idea is that the user can define projects and monitor their expenses. Projects could be e.g. expenses related to the opening of a new office, a project development etc.

There are three expense categories. Accounting, Business and Project. You decide which of these you want to use. Each expense that you generate can be then allocated to these. The tool can then sum up expenses based on different categories. You can also not use this function at all.
##To turn on project expense category in the main sheet where expenses are added:
To switch on the category project expenses turn top slider on.
##To activate or deactivate a project expense:
Set tickmark before project expense name on or off.
##To delete:
To delete expenses slide the expense you like to delete left. Press delete. If any expenses have been entered before using this project expense category they will retain the given project expense category.
##To add:
To add a new project expense category  - add the new expense category in line – new expense – and press the plus sign.
